## Introduction

Gemini is a monospaced ASCII rendering engine, capable of rendering 2D and 3D graphics in a terminal or console and written in Rust. This is a loose port of [gemini-py](https://github.com/redpenguinyt/gemini-py) which was made in Python but was deprecated due to performance limitations.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST use a monospace font in the terminal for the engine to render the view properly
