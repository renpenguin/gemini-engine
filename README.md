## Introduction

Gemini is a monospaced ASCII rendering engine, capable of rendering 2D and 3D graphics in a terminal or console and written in Rust. This is a loose port of [gemini-py](https://github.com/renpenguin/gemini-py) which was made in Python but was deprecated due to performance limitations.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST use a monospace font in the terminal for the engine to render the view properly
Looking for input? The [console-input](https://crates.io/crates/console-input) crate (also made by me) makes it easy to implement cross-platform input

- [Quick Start](https://docs.rs/gemini-engine/latest/gemini_engine/core/index.html)
- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/gemini-engine)
- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/gemini-engine)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/renpenguin/gemini-engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

As of now this is still a work in progress, so any feedback or issue requests would be very much appreciated :)

## Projects created using Gemini
- [display3d](https://github.com/renpenguin/display3d), a command line tool for displaying 3d objects in the terminal
- [A Tetris clone](https://github.com/renpenguin/console-tetris) written using Gemini and [console-input](https://crates.io/crates/console-input), an input library made for Gemini
